## Brief Introduction
In this project, I just tried to familiar with the structure and the implementation of AutoEncoder.
There are two  topics in this work. The first one is about the reconstruction of the MNIST image via autoencoder.
The second one is about using the latent code (vector) to produce the MNIST images through the decoder.   

## Image Info
I used MNIST database as the training and testing images.
- Training images: 60000 
- Testing images: 10000
- Image size: 28 * 28
